## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ai-tutor.git](https://github.com/your-username/ai-tutor.git)
cd ai-tutor
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv venv

```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Your API Key

This project requires a Google Gemini API key.

* Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
* Create a file at this exact location: `.streamlit/secrets.toml`.
* Add your API key to the `secrets.toml` file as shown below:

    **File: `.streamlit/secrets.toml`**
    ```toml
    # Your Google Gemini API Key
    GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    *Note: The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent this file from being uploaded to GitHub.*

## üé® How to Create the Dark Theme

The visual appearance of this app is controlled by a configuration file, not by complex CSS. This makes it easy to change the entire color scheme.

### Step 1: Create the Theme File

1.  In the main folder of your project, create a new folder and name it exactly `.streamlit` (with the dot at the beginning).
2.  Inside the `.streamlit` folder, create a new file named `config.toml`.
3.  Copy and paste the theme settings into this file.

### Step 2: Design the Theme

A great dark theme is about clarity and comfort. Here‚Äôs the design philosophy:

* **Base:** Start with a dark charcoal or gray (`#1e1e1e`) for the main background. This is easier on the eyes than pure black.
* **Accent:** Pick one single, vibrant color (`#4285F4`) that contrasts well with the dark background. This will be the `primaryColor` for buttons and interactive elements.
* **Depth:** Use a slightly lighter shade of your base color (`#2e2e2e`) for the `secondaryBackgroundColor`. This subtly lifts containers and chat bubbles off the main background.
* **Readability:** Select a soft, light color for text (`#f0f2f6`) that is easy to read against the dark base.

### Step 3: Write the Configuration

Here is the complete code for the `config.toml` file, which creates the professional "Carbon & Cobalt" theme for this app:

```toml
[theme]
# A confident, classic cobalt blue for interactive elements.
primaryColor = "#4285F4"

# A deep, neutral carbon black for the main background.
backgroundColor = "#1e1e1e"

# A slightly lighter charcoal for depth in containers.
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#2e2e2e"

# A very light, soft gray for text to ensure high contrast and readability.
textColor = "#f0f2f6"

# Font family for all text in the app.
font = "sans serif"

# Hides the default Streamlit menu and header
[server]
headless = true
[ui]
hideTopBar = true
```
